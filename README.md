# Calendar Website

One website for things that have to do with my professional productivity or health. For example:
1. GitHub calendar graph.
2. Similar images for going to the gym, working, etc. Feed all/many calendar events into it?
3. BG data/milestones.
4. Which days I run. Which days I lift weights. Which days I stretch. To that end, see this [search phrase](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r/search?q=Export%20calendar%20to%20csv%20-%20look%20at%20trends).

The first version, or starting point of this website is based on this repository [github-calendar](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/github-calendar).

The following are copied from the GitCalendar/github-calendar/example directory:
1. CalendarWebsite/css/
2. CalendarWebsite/js/
3. CalendarWebsite/index.html

Once this is functional, remove the bookmarked pages [here](chrome://bookmarks/?id=1367).
