# Progress

## Next Steps
1.
    Clean up repo so that

    a.
        the **unused branches** are deleted, closed, etc.

    b.
        the **branches** are structured such that:
        
        +-- master/main
            +-- dev
                +-- React.js branch with Java back end and database.
                +-- React Native branch with Java back end and database.

    c.
        the **directories** are structured such that:
        
        +-- root directory
            +-- front end directory
            +-- back end directory

    The front end on each branch will will look identical or similar.
    The functionality that it needs is to navigate between pages.
    And display info appropriate to that page.

    Something basic just to make sure
    * it's working as I want and need.
    * and to decide which to use
        * React.js
        * or React Native.

2.
    Then work on getting it behind a password/some sort of security.

3.
    Then bring in the database and back end.
