# hosting_progress

## Purpose

This file is to document what I am doing to deploy and host the project. 

And to document how I am doing it.

The intended goal is to get `~/Documents/DevFiles/personal_projects/PersonalDashboard/` hosted on a platform such as Heroku.

~~My first attempt is to host the front end on heroku in one "account" or "project". And to do the same for the back end. So that they are separated from each other.~~ 

This has changed. I now see that Heroku has a pipeline feature. I am now going to attempt to get `~/Documents/DevFiles/personal_projects/PersonalDashboard/` all uploaded in one "account" or "project.

To this end I am attempting to get just the front end working. And for that I am first using `Create and Deploy React App on Heroku - Step by Step Guide YouTube video.` (Under `react on heroku` from https://github.com/JamieBort/PersonalDashboard/blob/react_js/Progress.md#research) and this [Automate your create-react-app build on Heroku using Buildpack](https://medium.com/@antonybudianto/automate-your-create-react-app-build-on-heroku-using-buildpack-beb77408ffee) article.

NOTE: I attempted to learn more about the Heroku pipeline process. Hence this: https://dashboard.heroku.com/pipelines/f6714a28-2872-4d49-a017-502e755a5a6b
