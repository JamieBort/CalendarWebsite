# hosting_progress

## Purpose

This directory is for organizing my progress of trying to get the app hosted somewhere. Such as on Heroku.

And to document how I am doing it.

Each successive attempt will be documented in the `attemptXX.md` files, where XX is an integer starting with `01`. Each successive attempt will be incremented by 1.

The intended goal is to get `~/Documents/DevFiles/personal_projects/PersonalDashboard/` hosted on a platform such as Heroku.

## Status

See the [attempt01](https://github.com/JamieBort/PersonalDashboard/blob/host/hosting_progress/attempt01.md).md file.
