# attempt05

Using this directory to create a React.js frontend.

Using [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app) section of the React.js documentation.

## Status
Api call works to back end.

Navigation is set up. See https://github.com/JamieBort/PersonalDashboard/blob/react_js/frontend/attempt05/frontend/Resources.md

However need to figure out which component is best for this situation.
