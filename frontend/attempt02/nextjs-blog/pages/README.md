# pages

From [Navigate Between Pages](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/navigate-between-pages/pages-in-nextjs):
>In Next.js, a page is a React Component exported from a file in the pages directory.

>Pages are associated with a route based on their file name. For example, in development:
* pages/index.js is associated with the / route.
* pages/posts/first-post.js is associated with the /posts/first-post route.
