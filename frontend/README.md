# frontend

* First attempt - Running into `cors` issue with these.

    * `frontend_working_navigation` is a react app with working navigation.

    * next up: getting front end server working.

    * `nextjs-blog.js` spun up quickly. Used https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app/setup to do it.

    * Next up: create a different app using nextjs. And then incorporate navigation.

    * Having trouble making api calls. running into cors issue.

    * `vanilla_javascript` trying to address the cors issue.

* Second attempt - going to follow [this tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=nav-cta&utm_campaign=next-website) up through `Pre-rendering and Data Fetching`.
Stopped off at the end of the [Pre-rendering and Data Fetching](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/data-fetching/request-time) lesson.

* Third attempt - Copy of Second Attempt (where I stopped off at the end of the [Pre-rendering and Data Fetching](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/data-fetching/request-time) lesson) in an attempt to adapt it to a fetch to an external api.
**NOTE:** this didn't work for me either.
I am going to table this `attempt03` directory and this `react_js` branch for now.
And I will next attempt to make an call to the back end directly - assume the issues I am running into will not occur if I make a call to the back end directly...
If that fails, I will work on a course that will walk me through the process of making a fetch using JavaScript and possibly a library and/or framework.
