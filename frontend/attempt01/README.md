# ~~frontend~~ attempt01

* First attempt - Running into `cors` issue with these.

    * `frontend_working_navigation` is a react app with working navigation.

    * next up: getting front end server working.

    * `nextjs-blog.js` spun up quickly. Used https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app/setup to do it.

    * Next up: create a different app using nextjs. And then incorporate navigation.

    * Having trouble making api calls. running into cors issue.

    * `vanilla_javascript` trying to address the cors issue.

* Second a attempt - going to follow [this tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=nav-cta&utm_campaign=next-website) up through `Pre-rendering and Data Fetching`.
