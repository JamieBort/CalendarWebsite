# public

From [Assets, Metadata, and CSS](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/assets-metadata-css/assets):
>Next.js can serve static assets, like images, under the top-level public directory. Files inside public can be referenced from the root of the application similar to pages.

>The public directory is also useful for robots.txt, Google Site Verification, and any other static assets. Check out the documentation for Static File Serving to learn more.
